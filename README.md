## Architecture

Code is organized based on lab 4 frontend (some lab 5 stuff) right now.

Code library is based on Lab 4/5. Additionally, we have used react-particles-js

## Setup

Just `yarn` as of now! Download all your dependencies :) Yarn life.
Visit http://lifetime.surge.sh/ right now to see what we have.

## Deployment
heroku git: https://git.heroku.com/timimeline.git
heroku domain: https://timimeline.herokuapp.com/

To deploy the project, git clone both repos onto your local dev environment. Change the deploy URL in package.json to another surge URL and hit that `yarn deploy`.
