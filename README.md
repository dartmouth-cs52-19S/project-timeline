## Architecture

Code is organized based on lab 4 frontend (some lab 5 stuff) right now.

Code library is based on Lab 4/5.

## Setup

Just `yarn` as of now! :) Yarn life.

## Deployment
heroku git: https://git.heroku.com/timimeline.git
heroku domain: https://timimeline.herokuapp.com/

To deploy the project, git clone both repos onto your local dev environment. Change the deploy URL in package.json to another surge URL and hit that `yarn deploy`.
